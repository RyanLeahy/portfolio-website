                    Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Ryan Leahy and I am a Computer Engineering student at Gonzaga University. My goal is to specialize in embedded systems; thus, I am tailoring my experiences and course work at college around that. For as long as I could remember, I have been interested in electronics and how they work. I am a hands-on learner so the way I went about learning how electronics work was not always cost effective. My father learned early on it would be more cost effective to buy computers that were already broken, so I could tinker with them while maintaining his peace of mind. After years of breaking electronics to get a better understanding of what was happening ‚Äúunder the hood,‚Äù I turned to being able to fix common electronic problems. I went from the easy task of putting computers together at age ten to addressing more complex hardware issues with just a multimeter and deduction. Consequently, the growth of my hardware prowess came my ability to problem solve within the world of software in high school. I widened my horizons in high school. Not only did I take all of the programming classes offered at my school and excelled in them. I also started taking web design classes that taught me the basics of writing custom webpages and the basic principles of design. I enjoyed these classes so much because they felt immediately applicable to my passion projects outside of high school. One of which is this minimalist portfolio I wrote using the knowledge I worked hard to learn years ago. I wanted a place to showcase my completed projects and be inspired to find and complete more, so I wrote this website to do just that. I hope you enjoy exploring this timeline of my advancing abilities in embedded systems, wireless technology, networking, ISA‚Äôs, computer security, and cars üòä.
